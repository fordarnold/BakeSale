# Bakesale

A side-project for testing features and pushing the boundaries of the Laravel PHP framework. Personally, I see this as a __web-store for a bakery business + backend admin management system__

## Features

The app is still in development mode. This list of features will keep updating regularly. 

### Products management

Keep track of the different product offerings you provide.

### Categories management

Most people like to organise their products into categories. This feature allows you to do just that.

### Social authentication

Using laravel's [Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) package, users are now able to login with their favourite social networks e.g facebook, twitter or google.
